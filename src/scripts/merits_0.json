You might paint a picture that provokes viewers to feel the emotion “anger.” The manner in which the individual responds to feeling anger is up to the player of that character.

Because prey was scarce in the subterranean lairs, to ensure the survival of the Hungry the Creeps were forced to embrace generation after generation in a depraved attempt to cultivate and control a vampire herd from which to feed.
