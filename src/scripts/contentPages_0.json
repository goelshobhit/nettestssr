Although myth and superstition are not usually taken seriously in modern nights, there are some vampires who search for enlightenment, desperate to reject their vampiric nature. Despite all evidence pointing to the  impossibility of such a quest, there are those who refuse to give up hope. It is a candle in the darkness, a tale to be told when all other hopes have failed.\n\nThe search for Golconda is highly personal, and Storytellers are encouraged to be extremely demanding when players request a storyline about Golconda. Golconda is a near\u0002impossible goal, requiring centuries of character research and struggle (and, likely, years of real game time) to reach a Suspire, the moment when a vampire reaches enlightenment \nand achieves Golconda. \nBoth players and characters should be informed that there is no certainty in this search; extremely few vampires have ever successfully solved the riddle of the Beast and entered  this state. Golconda should not be a goal for every character, or even many characters. Players whose characters intend to seek this state should be willing, and even eager, to play out their eventual failure and downfall. Golconda may be nothing more than a myth, even – perhaps especially – if a character has poured her existence into finding it and sacrificed everything she loves. Vampire is a game of tragedy, and such an outcome would highlight the dark and poignant nature of the genre for all players.\n\nIt should be noted that many vampires hate the idea of Golconda and will struggle to ruin or destroy anyone seeking this state of enlightenment. The Ravnos clan believes that leaving behind one’s vampiric nature goes against the intrinsic order of the universe. Other vampires, in particular the Lasombra, preach that God created vampires to do his work; therefore, working to escape your vampiric state is blasphemy, a rejection of God’s will. The Setites, who delight in corruption, will take every opportunity to ruin a potential Golconda seeker through temptation, manipulation, or blackmail. Vampires of the Sabbat actively seek to destroy those questing after Golconda, claiming that such a creature is defying Caine. Elders of the Camarilla scorn the idea of Golconda as, at best, lies and foolishness — at worst, infernalism. Overall, a vampire actively seeking this state has chosen to travel a hard road, indeed.\n\n\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"system":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"The Road to Suspire","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\nGolconda is a personal struggle to overcome the Beast, but there are commonalities in the path to Suspire. It is critical that one’s Beast be made as weak as possible. The Beast feeds on depravity, vicious actions, thoughtless deeds, strong emotions, murder, and mayhem — but it also gains sustenance from small sins and wicked thoughts. Even those subtleties must be purged from the vampire’s soul.\n\n• Sacrifice: This process demands that the vampire sacrifices everything meaningful — social and political status, personal goals, friends, family, and finally, her sense of self. A character must have no other goal, absolutely no other care or concern, other than Golconda. In some ancient vampiric tales, the final act before reaching this state involves a literal sacrifice of that which the vampire loves most, as in the biblical tale of Abraham and Isaac. Your Storyteller will determine what is appropriate. \n• Acceptance: The vampire must fully accept her nature. She must research and study the vampiric condition, the myths of the various clans, and the history of undead society as fully as possible. She must also learn to clearly distinguish the drives of her soul versus the subtle pressures of her Beast. There must be no question where the line is drawn between the two.\n• Amends: Humanity – including both mortals and vampires – is a race of flawed creatures. A person capable of reaching Suspire must have no wrongs and no burdens on her soul. She must amend for the wrongs she has done, in mortal life and in unlife, and be forgiven and absolved of those acts. If she fails to recognize a wrong she has committed or does not fully make amends, the character will certainly fail to reach Suspire.\n• Suffering: Suspire is not an easy thing to achieve, and Golconda is not an easy state to maintain. A Storyteller should consider whether the character has been adequately impeded by her quest, and whether her struggles, failures, and sacrifices have created a powerful story for others within the chronicle. Although Golconda is a private quest, LARP is a social experience, and anything with this much import to the story should be looked at with the entire game’s best interest in mind.\n• Humanity: If a vampire’s Humanity ever drops below 5, she has lost her way and must begin the path to Suspire all over again. The Beast is made stronger by each such failure, and the following attempts to reach Golconda will be even more diffi cult. After three of these, the  vampire’s Beast has won, and she can no longer seek Suspire. The Storyteller may rule that the Beast has grown so strong that the vampire automatically enters permanent frenzy, or wassail, and must be retired from the game.\n\n\n\n","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"The Benefits of Enlightenment","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\nMany outcomes exist for a character who has reached Golconda. Because Golconda is a spiritual state and deeply personal to each adherent, the results may be slightly different for every vampire — even as the path to Suspire was personal to each seeker. These are some possible results, spoken of in vampire legends. Your Storyteller will determine which, if any, are appropriate for your character and, most importantly, for her game environment. These mythical outcomes, and more, are whispered about in vampire society, but no one knows the truth.\n• The vampire breaks the curse and once again becomes entirely human, with no trace of her \nprevious vampiric condition.\n• The vampire ascends to an angelic state. She will be freed from the detriments of the curse of Caine, but will retain her vampiric abilities. \n• The vampire physically incarnates and releases her Beast, which roams the world as an independent creature: the proverbial monster in the dark. \n• The vampire loses her clan weakness, and she is gifted with the ability to learn all vampiric disciplines and powers without the need for a teacher. She may even be able to learn and utilize powers that could not previously be supported by her blood, such as elder powers or techniques.\n• The vampire becomes completely emotionally balanced, working with her Beast instead of struggling against it. The Beast is tamed; she can enter or leave frenzy at will, without any of the penalties of that state. \n• The Beast is cast out of the soul and becomes part of the vampire’s fl esh. The vampire takes on an unnatural, ancient beauty beyond any mortal capacity. The vampire’s flesh is rendered invulnerable to everything except the weaponry of faith; she cannot be harmed by normal ordnance, sunlight, fire, and even Physical\u0002based disciplines such as Potence or Wolf’s Claws. \n\nThese are only a few of the possible results gained by reaching the enlightenment of Golconda. Because such creatures are incredibly rare, and necessarily do not associate freely with  other vampires, information is scarce. As with the path to Suspire, if a vampire in Golconda ever has her Humanity drop below 5, she loses her way. Such a vampire will immediately fall out of Golconda, likely succumbing to a powerful frenzy (or even permanent wassail) as her Beast, which had been contained, is suddenly set free. Player-characters may strive to reach Golconda and may purchase the Golconda Seeker merit, but a character who \nhas achieved Golconda loses her player-character status and becomes an NPC,\n\n\n\n\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"sourceBook":[{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"yicuw1hpxsdg"}},"id":"1Xzcnrx0liSdyDzRYYQ6L7","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-02-18T04:09:40.151Z","updatedAt":"2021-04-06T16:50:00.830Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sourcebook"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"bookTitle":"MET - VTM - Core Book","system":["Vampire the Masquerade"]}}],"isLibraryEntry":true},"sys":{"id":"6ZXKu8gtz8fxNDr0qT9ry2","type":"Entry"}},{"fields":{"title":"Feeding","quote":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"“She did not seduce, she ravished.”\n— George Meredith, Diana of the Crossways\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"description":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"Biting","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\nA vampire can extend her fangs and use her standard action to bite a grappled opponent, choosing either to draw blood or to attack and inflict aggravated damage.

While it is possible to kill a vampire, she will not age or die of natural causes. She does not need water, food, or air. For all intents and purposes, a vampire is a corpse, albeit one revived through the magic inherent in the blood.\n• Vampires require the blood of the living to survive. While vampires are corpses, they still require nourishment to sustain themselves, and as in the myths, they feast on blood. Not only does blood preserve their undead bodies, it allows vampires to perform amazing and supernatural feats of healing, strength, or speed. Most vampires seek human blood, although some force themselves to drink animal blood (which tastes foul and unsatisfying to a vampire). Some elder vampires must hunt their younger brethren for feeding, as they are no longer able to gain sustenance from human blood. A vampire need not kill her prey; some take only a little blood and hide the evidence of their feeding. A vampire can repair surface \nwounds caused by her bite simply by licking them.\n• Anyone who dies from a vampire’s bite will become a vampire. If this statement were true, the world would be overrun with vampires! Instead, those bitten and drained by vampires in the course of feeding simply die. It takes a very special and purposeful process, known as \nthe Embrace, to create a new vampire.\n• Vampires are burned by sunlight. True. Vampires must avoid sunlight or risk death. Vampires are nocturnal creatures, and most find it difficult to stay awake during the day, even if they are well-hidden from the sunlight .\n• Vampires are repelled by garlic, they can’t cross running water, and they cast no refl ections. These myths are partially true. Some vampires, notably those of a particular clan, cast no refl ection. However, vampires are creatures of superstition, and some may avoid these things out of a psychological compulsion.\n• A cross or other holy symbol can repel a vampire. Generally untrue. The symbol itself has little power. Instead, vampires fear the faith of the person wielding the symbol — and genuine faith is rare.\n• Vampires will die from a stake through the heart. While they cannot die from such wounds, vampires are immobilized by wooden stakes, arrows, crossbow bolts, and similar items that pierce the heart. Once the item is removed, the vampire’s mobility is restored.\n\n\n\n\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"sourceBook":[{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"yicuw1hpxsdg"}},"id":"1Xzcnrx0liSdyDzRYYQ6L7","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-02-18T04:09:40.151Z","updatedAt":"2021-04-06T16:50:00.830Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sourcebook"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"bookTitle":"MET - VTM - Core Book","system":["Vampire the Masquerade"]}}],"isLibraryEntry":true},"sys":{"id":"7fLJouX9tOMiMcgXxlmJfg","type":"Entry"}},{"fields":{"title":"Equipment Generation System","description":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"In order to allow both flexibility and simplicity, Mind’s Eye Theatre uses an equipment generation system.

To play a clan denoted as uncommon or rare, you must purchase the associated merit, below. \n\nBuying an uncommon, rare, or restricted clan merit doesn’t mean that your character is an established member of the base society in that setting.

Your character’s loyalties are determined by you with the help and support of your Storyteller.\n\nRarity merits count against a character’s merit limit of 7 points. Purchasing the Rare Clan merit means you have spent 4 points and may only buy 3 more points of merits for this character. Your Storyteller may limit some clans more strictly. When a clan is noted as Restricted or is not on the list of acceptable clans for a setting, that indicates your Storyteller feels the clan is not appropriate for her chronicle.

The Restricted \nClan merit may also be purchased to play a clan’s bloodline  if it would cost more than 6 XP due to rarity in your setting. \n\nIf playing a Lasombra is rare in your setting, you would need to pay 4 XP to play this clan; taking the Lasombra bloodline Kiaysd (a 4 point merit) would cost another 4 XP, a total of 8 XP. Ordinarily, that combination of merits would exceed the 7-point merit cap. However, with your Storyteller’s permission, you may play that character type with a 6-point expenditure by purchasing the Restricted Clan merit.\nFor example, if you wanted to play the Lamia bloodline (4 merit points) of the Cappadocian clan (Rare Clan: 4 merit points) in the Camarilla setting, you would use the Restricted Clan merit instead to pay for the combination of merits.

A character’s clan and bloodline must be the same as her sire; a sire’s Embrace always creates a vampire of her clan and bloodline (if any).

A location cannot have multiple instances of the same quality unless otherwise noted.\n- Artistic: This location is a work of art in and of itself. Controlling this stock location gives the character an additional dot of the Fame background so long as she is known to\ncontrol it. \n- Cutting Edge: This location is a modern marvel of technological design, with all aspects of the infrastructure built towards one goal: delivering a singularly impressive high-tech experience. Controlling this location provides a character with access to what is effectively a technologically-replicated, unfocused ability to replicate the Path of Technomancy power Analyze while within the location. Furthermore, the controlling character receives a +3 wild card bonus to challenges involving the Computers skill while at this location.\n- Dead Zone: This building is cut off from any sort of cellular or internet service. Characters find it impossible to get online or even make phone calls without special access such as a landline or dedicated wi-fi (should the owner provide it). This area is also immune to mystical powers that control technology, such as the blood magic Path of Technomancy or the werewolf gift Jam Technology. Some speculate that there are other, hitherto-unknown factions who limit the encroachment of supernaturals at such locations. Others believe these locations may be affected by the Second Inquisition.\n- Distracting: Due to some feature of the location, such as loud music, flashing lights, or no light at all, one struggles to keep track of details or people while present in it. The powers Heightened Senses, Wolf Senses, or any comparable sensory enhancement do not function here, even for the character who controls this location.\n- Fancy: This location is in a spot where the wealthy and elegant love to congregate, making it easy for its controller to orchestrate backroom deals. A character who controls this location receives one additional Elite influence action each downtime cycle.\n- Firewall: This location has been designed to prevent others from remotely accessing its data and security systems. The difficulty of attempts to penetrate computer systems at this location increases by 3. Characters with both the Computer skill and have purchased the Haven background for this location receive the Firewall benefit for free.\n- Guards: Armed guards regularly patrol this location. Anyone who tries to infiltrate this location must contend with 5 dots of Retainers guarding it. When choosing this quality, the player may assign five level-1 Retainers, one level-5 Retainer, or any other combination adding up to five. Guards also add +1 to the difficulty of any quest to physically infiltrate the location. Location guards only protect this location, and they cannot travel\n- Hangout: This location is a gathering place for mortal residents from various walks of life. Its controller gains access to one additional instance of the Contacts background at 1 dot. This benefit does not raise the level of a character's existing Contacts, and it is treated as a separate background.\n- Historic: This location has cultural or historical significance, making control of it much more complicated. Add +1 to the difficulty of any quest to take control of this location.\n- Lowdown and Dirty: This location is a spot where underworld figures love to congregate, making it easy for its controller to orchestrate deals. A character who controls this location receives one additional Underworld influence action each downtime cycle. \n- Hole in the Wall: This location is difficult to find unless you know what you're looking for. This location cannot be targeted or affected by other characters unless they have personally been there.\n- Isolated: This location is isolated from mortals, and is thus relatively safe as regards the Masquerade. Only the most egregious breaches attract outside attention.\n- Laboratory: This location contains a highly specialized research laboratory. Choose one Science skill specialization. This location confers a +3 wild card bonus to challenges related to that field of study. A location can have multiple instances of the Laboratory quality, applying to a different Science specialization each time.\n- Library: The location features an extensive library, on a variety of subjects not accessible to mortals. Before making a Lore skill test, a character may spend one hour looking things up in the library and receive a +3 wild card bonus to her test pool.\n- Location: The location is in an area that affords it some protection, such as being in a prestigious neighborhood, atop a lonely mountain, or at the end of a winding, private road. Anyone using downtime actions to negatively affect this facility must spend twice as many downtime actions to do so. In addition, the Storyteller may award certain story benefits relevant to the location (police respond quickly when called, nearby roads get cleared first when the weather is bad, etc.)\n- Luxury: The location is filled with comfortable and expensive amenities, such as televisions, automatic chairs, computers, or works of art. The location owner receives a +3 bonus to Social attribute tests versus mortals in this location.\n- Off the Grid: This location has no electronic systems as part of its workings, yet it is fully functional in all other aspects, including security. This location cannot be infiltrated via the internet or be impacted through typical bureaucratic means\n- Profitable: This location generates income for its controller, treated as if she had an additional instance of the Resources background at 1 dot. This benefit does not raise the level of a character's existing Resources background, and it is treated as a separate background.\n- Public Property: This location is a public facility, owned by the local government, but controlled by a vampire. Add +3 to the difficulty of any bureaucratic action targeting this facility. In addition, this location ignores the first instance of the Out of Code negative quality assigned to it. The second instance of Out of Code is treated as the first, ultimately requiring four instances before the location is rendered inoperable.\n- Refuge: This location has an emergency power system, as well as food supplies (including blood, if controlled by a vampire). Each level of this location's rating gives it enough resources for a single individual to remain for 30 days without emerging, which the controller can divide to accommodate additional parties or combine for a longer duration for fewer characters.\n- Security: The location has a basic security system installed. Any challenges to break in suffer a -3 penalty. In addition, the controlling character always receives at least one turn of warning if she is present during a break-in attempt (no matter how well the attacker tests). Characters with the Security skill may receive this benefit for free on locations that are designated as their Haven background, but Security must be separately assigned to multiple locations.\n- Size: The location is enormous, with dozens of rooms, or a wide enclosed space. A warehouse's worth of goods, supplies, people, or anything else can be safely hidden away\nfrom the world here.\n- Sprawling: Characters unfamiliar with this location find it confusing to navigate. Characters wishing to speak privately should notify the Storyteller of their intent, and they are then considered to be in a different location for the purposes of observation. Furthermore, characters who do not control this stock location may not declare fair escape while present, and a character wishing to leave the site must spend five minutes unchallenged before making her exit.\n- Staff: The location includes several servants who see to the needs of the owner and guests. Staff don't normally fight; but if they are forced to engage, treat them as 1-dot Retainers with no combat specialties. They are available at all times, but are not entirely self-sufficient; Staff cannot be used to raise the total number of locations a character can control.\n- Sturdy: This location is particularly hard to ruin, thanks to solid construction. Add +3 to the difficulty of any action that would cause physical damage to this location, such as breaking down doors. In addition, the location ignores the first Damaged negative quality assigned to it. The second instance of Damaged is treated as the first, ultimately requiring four instances before the location is destroyed.\n- Venue: This location is an excellent performance venue. Choose one Performance skill specialization. This location confers a +3 wild card bonus to non-supernatural challenges related to that skill specialization. A location can have multiple instances of the Venue quality, applying to a different Performance specialization each time.\n- Workshop: This location is designed for making things. Choose one Craft skill specialization. This location confers a +3 wild card bonus to challenges related to that skill specialization. A location can have multiple instances of the Workshop quality, applying to a different Crafts specialization each time.\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"\n\n\n\n","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}}]},"sourceBook":[{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"yicuw1hpxsdg"}},"id":"18ZqrGQa6cKbUWo2sVcte0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-02-18T04:10:10.444Z","updatedAt":"2021-04-06T16:49:42.068Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sourcebook"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"bookTitle":"MET - VTM - V2 Issue 1","system":["Vampire the Masquerade"]}}],"isLibraryEntry":true,"directLibraryParent":{"fields":{"title":"Stock Locations","quote":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\"You can design and create and build the most wonderful place in the world.

In many cases, they simply cannot be controlled by player-characters; in other cases, they can be brought under some control. Should that happen, this control is always conditional.

This difficulty rating encompasses everything from picking a lock to hacking into a computer. \n\nChallenging Locations During Downtime\nIf a character wants to infiltrate a location as a downtime action, the Storyteller can handle this request using the quest system. Assign a the character a quest proportional to the type of building, at a difficulty equal to its rating. The player(s) involved should choose a single, simple victory condition, such as stealing a particular item, planting evidence, or rescuing a prisoner, which they achieve if successful.\nFor Standard Locations, this quest can be a relatively simple affair, but for prestige and iconic locations, security systems and plans become much more complicated, and defeating them becomes something more like a heist. The Storyteller should modify the difficulty based on the building’s qualities and is further free to modify the difficulty as she sees fit based on other circumstances. Note that a location’s qualities may raise a quest’s difficulty rating to 6 or higher.\nThis system assumes players operate with some degree of finesse. Should a character decide that she wishes to bash her way into a building, such as by openly displaying vampiric disciplines or assuming Crinos form, she should expect her Storyteller to hand out severe consequences.

For centuries, philosophers have debated the existence and purpose of the human soul, and considered how this nebulous concept defines our morals, actions, and how we relate to one another.\nSome claim that humanity’s entire existence has been an intrinsic, existential search to define the soul and explore its functionality, while seeking the true purpose behind life.\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Vampire: The Masquerade is a game that focuses on the internal struggle between darkness and light, right and wrong, virtue and vice.

At times, these outcomes may be social sanctions or physical encounters, but there is also a possibility that they will stir a vampire’s Beast. This dramatic system uses two unique traits to simulate and showcase this struggle:\n- Humanity is defined in Mind’s Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade as a metric determining how much of a character’s mortal soul remains, despite the Curse of Caine. Humanity represents a vampire’s tie to morality: an endless struggle to some and a\nshield to others.\n- Beast traits represent the relative potency of a character’s Beast, increasing as it actively strengthens or emerges. Incurring a Beast trait represents a moment of weakness, surrendering to the seductive and destructive nature of the Beast. \nThe chart listed on page 300 of MET:VTM was designed to be a broad, quick-and-dirty guideline for Storytellers and players to easily determine how to assign Beast traits during the course of a game session. Using it, a vampire should be able to feel the slip of her Humanity on a nightly basis, taking a walk on the wild side without random significant loss. Losing Humanity is a long, slow grind—a story of true terror.\nThe following expanded system reorganizes and reimagines the previous rules, broadening them from the narrow perspective of engaging in violence to opening a character up to the depravations of the Beast.

During moments of extreme stress, it seeks to assert itself, overwhelming the vampire’s psyche and taking control, throwing the character into frenzy. Resisting the urge to frenzy involves a very real struggle between a vampire and her Beast; either it succeeds, or she does. However, there is a third option: riding the wave.\nA character who rides the wave seeks to satisfy her urges before they overcome her, rather than attempt  to deny them outright. Riding the wave is an extreme reaction to a frenzy-inducing stimulus, acknowledging it as a threat in a very overt way. Riding the wave is different from frenzy. Powers or effects that rely on a character being in frenzy do not apply when she is riding the wave. Instead, she is in a state just beneath frenzy.\nWhen confronted with a stimulus that would cause a frenzy check, players may choose instead to ride the wave. If they do, they skip the frenzy check, but must instead react in an extreme and dramatic fashion to the situation, possibly acting in a manner that others might consider embarrassing or overblown. However, to the character, the emotion she experiences is very real. When a character rides the wave, she must continue acting in a dramatic fashion until the stimulus of her frenzy is removed or resolved.\nThis outcome may require separating her from an offending party, ingesting some quantity of blood, extinguishing a fire, or leaving a location. In all cases, the reaction should be overt. A Storyteller may rule that a character attempting to ride the wave fails if she does not sufficiently react to a frenzy-inducing stimulus, instead requiring the player to make a test to resist frenzy.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\n","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"italic"}],"value":"Riding the Wave in Different Situations","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\n- Rage Frenzy: A character on the verge of rage frenzy is at the limits of her patience.

For example, the character may yell an angry retort. (Please keep player safety and comfort in mind at all times when using this option; feel free to narrate or pantomime your actions as appropriate.)\n- Hunger Frenzy: The onset of hunger frenzy can pose a serious threat to the Masquerade. Instead of giving in, a character may ride the wave to assume a distinctly predatory demeanor and seek out the nearest source of mortal blood, attempting to catch it unawares. The vampire continues to do so until she has successfully consumed enough Blood points eliminate the need for a frenzy check.\n- Fear Frenzy: Fear frenzy is the Beast’s attempt to preserve itself in the face of a mortal threat. Rather than flee in uncontrollable terror, a character riding the wave may shriek, yell, or recoil away from the offending source.

The vampire will enter a frenzied, incredibly violent state known as wassail, and she will never return to lucidity.\n\nFledglings thrust into undead society often cling to the trappings of their mortal lives. Their original belief systems become guides, reminding them which actions are right and which are wrong, even when the vampire can no longer instinctively tell the difference. This ethical code is known as one’s Humanity: the semblance of living according to positive moral values and principles. By clinging to these innate guidelines, a vampire can fight against the Beast and retain her sanity.\nHowever, a vampire cannot ignore the fact that she is a monster. Even a vampire with a high Humanity rating feels the Beast inside, scratching at her spirit and demanding blood. As a vampire’s Humanity erodes, she becomes jaded and blasé. She may even actively pursue progressively depraved acts in order to feel anything at all. With little memory of her Humanity to guide her, a vampire’s behavior becomes callous in the extreme, utterly degenerate and monstrously predatory. She becomes a beacon of evil, and those nearby – undead and mortal alike – actively feel disconcerted, as something alien and terrible moves among them.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"system":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"Gaining Beast Traits","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\nEvery time your character commits a sin, you gain temporary Beast traits equal to the level of the sin.

A character may control up to five separate locations, plus one additional location for each dot she possesses of the Retainer or Kinfolk backgrounds.\nOwnership of locations can be complex. Not every location can be “owned” in the classical sense, with a formal deed in the character’s name. A variety of desirable locations are public property, impossible to be wholly owned by a private entity. However, supernatural creatures have various means to exert influence over mortals. Gaining de facto control of a location is just as effective as de jure. This power can be ascertained through indirect means, such as a vampire establishing a blood bond, a werewolf sending kinfolk to fill key operational positions, or a changeling weaving an elaborate web of seduction to ensnare a city council member. For the purpose of this system, determining the nature of the control exerted is  necessary only for story, as the system treats all means as effectively equal.\n\nIn addition, not every location is obtainable. A Storyteller is free to determine as befits her game whether a particular location can be controlled. If the Storyteller decides to make a location controllable, she should create a record for it, noting who currently controls the location and what its qualities are. Characters have access to the public information for locations they control, though certain information about them may not be known (such as if the location has been covertly compromised).

For example, a city building would not be considered a new location; but a player wishing for her character to enter play as the owner of a local bar creates the bar as a new location, including its name and history (which the player may write if the Storyteller agrees). When pursuing control of an already existing location, such as wanting to buy a bar, the player determines the characteristics of the location her character is looking for, passing on locations that lack the qualities she desires until she finds the place best suited for her needs.\nTo gain control of a new location, Storytellers should work with the player to understand what sort of location her character is looking for, and have her undertake a quest proportionate to the type and rating of the location.

This practice requires one vampire to drink from another, exsanguinating all of the victim’s blood and continuing past that point to feast upon a vampire’s very soul. To do so imbues the diablerist with new potency, permanently concentrating her blood. This act terrifies elders, who fear that a time may come when young, thin-blooded vampires will rise up and attempt to steal the elders’ power, consuming their souls in the process.\nVampires known to have practiced such an act are typically hunted down and destroyed.\n\nThere are many spiritual beliefs concerning diablerie. Some clans believe it is a spiritual act, one that forever merges the soul of the diablerist with her victim. Others claim that it is a vampire’s way of delivering God’s greatest punishment, removing a particularly evil soul from the cycle forever. Many vampire faiths have doctrines explaining the nature of diablerie within their belief systems, and even outside of these religious beliefs, vampires are highly superstitious and fearful of the act.\nUndead legend tells many dark tales of murderous childer betraying and cannibalizing their sires, and it is for this reason more than any other that elder vampires harbor a great distrust for weaker vampires. Further, diablerie is addictive, and those who commit this sin even once fi nd that their Beasts rage forever with a powerful, almost unconquerable desire to do so again. Even centuries later, they can still remember the taste of the heart’s blood, and they occasionally awaken from dreams wherein they were experiencing the blissful moment\nof gluttony over and over again.\n\nThose who commit diablerie experience the spiritual merging of the consumed soul into their bodies. Memories, along with the power of that individual’s blood, surge through the practitioner at the time of the act, and those memories will linger for the rest of the vampire’s eternal existence. In ancient days, clans such as the Salubri and the Assamites claimed to know secrets that allowed diablerists to access their victims’ memories freely and live in peace with those they had consumed. Few modern vampires have this capacity or knowledge. A diablerist finds herself forever changed, her personality affected by the resonance of the person she diablerized. Unlike the Beast, the victim’s spirit is not sentient within the diablerist, but rather exists as a subtle influence, like old habits or unquestioned beliefs. A diablerist will find herself remembering half-understood moments of her victim’s life as if they were her own, and she will discover that her perspective on the world has forever been colored by the\npersonality of the individual whose spirit she has consumed\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"system":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"Committing Diablerie","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\nTo commit diablerie, you must torpor a vampire and drain all of her blood.

Characters have goals different from other characters, and taking action against them can result in social consequences or retaliation. Such conflicts also usually escalate quickly, with character death as a common occurrence, resulting in an unsatisfying conclusion for one party. Conflicts like this can also lead to blunt or uncreative gameplay tangents, or bleed when character conflict becomes too intense. However, just as LARP is an experience in cooperative storytelling, rival can also be handled cooperatively. \nAs a means of entertainment, professional wrestling is all about showcasing conflict. Every match, promo, and interview centers on conflict, with an occasional McGuffin of a championship belt thrown in. Writers must handle challenges of talent rotating in and out, and establishing the core of a character in a very short time. In preparation for premium events, the show builds rivalries which must appear both interesting and believable enough for an audience for the purpose of creating a grand spectacle of a finale. \nCooperative conflict is different than most clashes in LARP. Instead of being competitive, the purpose of cooperative conflict is to tell a story. With the competitive aspect either removed or managed more effectively, all participants gain the benefit of becoming collaborators rather than competitors. Working together, they tell the story of their rivalry, giving one another ample time to shine.Entering into this sort of agreement is optional, of course.

If you succeed in the challenge, you force your target to drop one item of your choice. Picking the item up requires a standard action. If you are Dexterity-focused and have a free hand, you may choose to end up holding the disarmed object.

While grappled she can’t move and cannot use her standard action to take a Physical action. She can escape from your Grapple by using a simple action and besting you in an opposed challenge (Brawl or Melee). Upon escaping, the target regains full use of her standard action. (She doesn’t have to wait until the next round to use it.) You relinquish your Grapple if you take any action that targets anyone other than the character you’re grappling, or if you move more than one step per round. If a single character is being grappled by more than one opponent, she need only best one opponent to escape. If the grappling characters cannot decide who will resist the attempt to break out, the Storyteller\ndecides. As long as your character is grappled, she is considered the target of a Physical challenge each round (allowing others to only target her with one additional Physical attack per round). With the right equipment or supernatural power, it is possible to Grapple at range, but a Grapple cannot be used as a prerequisite for a supernatural attack unless you Grapple with your hands. For example, you can’t throw a net at someone and then use Cauldron of Blood, because you have not grappled the target with your hands.\n\n• Knock Out : If you surprise your target, you may attempt to knock her unconscious. Modify your attack test pool by -2. If you succeed, your target is unconscious for 10 minutes. You can only use this maneuver during the first round of combat, and you can’t use it if your target\nis expecting an attack. (Some supernatural creatures, such as vampires, cannot be knocked unconscious.)\n\n• Quick Draw : You can draw one weapon or other small item on your person without using a simple action.\n\n• Knock Down : If you succeed with a Knock Down attack, your opponent takes 1 less damage (minimum 0) and ends up lying on the ground. While prone, your opponent may use an action to crawl one step. A prone character can use a simple action to stand up and move up to one step.\n\n• Fighting Blind : If you can’t see your opponent, you must use this combat maneuver to attack her. If you don’t use this combat maneuver, your attack will automatically miss.\n\n• Pierce the Heart : If your opponent’s wounds are in the Incapacitated wound track, you may attempt to use a melee or ranged weapon to Pierce her Heart.

Typically, an Acceptance ritus is a game or individual challenge for all members of the pack, establishing the new hierarchy of dominance. If the individual does well, she is respected as an equal. If she does poorly, she may not be allowed to join the pack at all. This ritual is also performed to celebrate the sect’s acceptance of new True Sabbat when they are given Initiation through the Creation Rites.\n• Danse Macabre (also called the Farewell Ritus): This Ignoblis is more somber than others, and packs use it to bid farewell to the spirits and memories of fellow Sabbat after they have been destroyed. The farewell rites usually involve each person in attendance offering a sacrifice to go with the departed. When this ritual is performed on a nomadic pack leaving an area, these sacrifices are often gifts given to help that pack survive its travels.\n• Running the Gauntlet: This ritus includes physical games and challenges involving direct combat between two or more participants, always performed in some public manner, so that the rest of the Sabbat can watch and learn from the battle.\n• Sacrificial Rites: This ritual involves the sacrifice of a human, werewolf, or vampire. Typically, the first half of this ritus is a challenge to acquire an appropriate sacrifice (alive and not significantly harmed). Such a sacrifice is usually defined at the start of the ritus, and then the\nvampires are sent to perform the task. If they succeed, the sacrifice is performed in the bloodiest method possible, and its remains are left behind so that the enemies of the Sabbat can see, and fear, the power of the Sword of Caine.\n• Stealth: The Ignoblis Ritae of stealth come in many varieties, from vowing silence and cutting out tongues, to see who can remain silent the longest, to physical tests of silence, such as moving through a Camarilla-controlled area without gaining the attention of the enemy.\n• Sun Dance: The Sun Dance ritus is held from sunset to sunrise without pause. Pack members usually dress in masks or paint, depicting their greatest battles or most significant points of pride. The Sun Dance is a test of endurance; no wounds may be healed from the moment the ritus begins to the moment the sun rises on the next morning. The ritus involves chanting, dancing, counting coup upon other sect members (through a single strike) and praising one’s pack accomplishments.\n• Vision Quest: In some packs, if an individual wishes to become leader or seeks guidance from Caine, she goes on a vision quest. The Sabbat member’s vision quest involves meditation, starvation (no feeding for at least a week before the ritus), and a pageant play by her pack and associates. The topic of the pageant is always a relevant story of Caine or of vampiric myth and history, related to the individual’s questions and concerns. The individual seeking enlightenment watches this pageant (along with any other audience, often at an esbat). If her faith is stalwart enough, she is said to receive a vision of a course of action, though doubters say this may simply be hunger and the will of the Beast rising within her psyche.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\n","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"italic"}],"value":"System","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\nParticipating in an Ignoblis Ritae provides a +1 wild card bonus to one challenge performed within the next three nights.

To work against the subject’s best interest, you must spend a Willpower per scene; to attack the subject, you must spend a point of Willpower each round. You must also spend a Willpower to kill her or to knowingly allow her to be killed.\n• Have you participated in a Vaulderie with this individual more than 10 times in the last year?

You can disagree with her or cause her troubles, but you actively do not wish to cause her harm.\n• Have you participated in a Vaulderie with this individual more than once in the past year?

The defeated cannot return to the area for a period of five years or until the victor relents, whichever is sooner. If the victor dies during this period, she cannot relent, and the defeated vampire must serve the full time in exile.

The victor is allowed to choose someone other than herself, provided the replacement agrees to accept the post.
