You transform into slightly smaller versions of the same animal you would normally become by using Shape of the Beast. If your Shape of the Beast allows you to turn into a bat, you can turn into several smaller bats using Animal Swarm.\n\nThis swarm consists of one animal for each dot of Celerity you possess. Elder powers and Celerity-based techniques do not increase the number of animals created by Animal Swarm. Each animal can act independently and can take one simple and one standard action each turn. While using Animal Swarm, you cannot spend Blood and lose access to all other powers. Even powers that were activated before using Animal Swarm stop functioning while in this form.\n\nActivating Animal Swarm does not reverse permanent physical alterations. For example, if your heart is removed it will not reappear when you activate this power. Each of your animals has your Mental attribute, Social attribute, focuses and skills. By default, these animals inflict 1 point of aggravated damage with a successful Brawl attack. If your character possesses any Potence powers, your animals’ attacks are armor-piercing and inflict 2 points of aggravated damage. Each creature has 5 health levels (1 Healthy, 2 Injured, and 2 Incapacitated). Your merits, flaws, and powers do not affect the health levels of your animal swarm. \nIf your character possesses any Fortitude powers, each of your animals automatically negates 1 point of normal or aggravated damage each time they suffer damage. If your animals attempt to retest in combat, each animal must spend Willpower separately; they use your Willpower pool to do so. While swarming in your flight form, each animal gains a +1 bonus to Dodge-based defensive test pools and can fly at your normal movement speed. \n\nIn flight form, your Physical attribute is considered 1 when you are attacking. While in fight form, each of your animals has a Physical attribute equal to half of your own Physical attribute (round up). Other bonuses from Shape of the Beast do not apply while using Animal Swarm.\n\nAnimals created by Animal Swarm can separate and perform individual tasks, but must remain within one mile of each other. You can use a standard action to return to your human form at the location of any animal created by this power. When you revert to human form, you automatically reabsorb any of your animals that are within your line of sight. Animals not within your line of sight crumble at the same moment, turning into ash. When Animal Swarm\nends, you take 2 points of aggravated damage for each animal that was destroyed, 1 point of aggravated damage for each animal that was injured or incapacitated, and you lose 2 Blood for each animal that was outside of your line of sight when you reformed. Damage taken from reverting to human form cannot be reduced or negated, but cannot kill your character (although it may result in torpor). If all of the animals in a swarm are destroyed, the power’s user dies. Animals created by this power are considered to be one entity for the purpose of powers that modify an individual’s behavior. If one animal is Dominated, all of the animals in\nthe swarm suffer the effects of that power. If one animal cannot break an individual’s Majesty, none of the animals in the swarm can attack that individual.\n\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"prerequisites":["Protean 4","Celerity 2"],"disciplines":[{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"yicuw1hpxsdg"}},"id":"35zxio2h8II43zdwdRp25x","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-03-23T18:29:35.792Z","updatedAt":"2021-04-08T16:57:53.918Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"discipline"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Shape of the Beast","power":"Protean","parent":false,"summary":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"One of the most renowned abilities possessed by vampires, this power allows you to take the form of a wolf or bat, literally shifting your ﬂesh and bone into a new state.
