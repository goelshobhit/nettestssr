The nest consists of one snake for each Obfuscate power that you possess. Elder powers and Obfuscate-based techniques do not increase the number of serpents created by Snake Den. Each serpent can act independently and can take one simple and one standard action each turn. While using Snake Den, you cannot spend Blood and lose access to all other powers, except where noted below. Even powers that were activated before using Snake Den stop functioning while in this form. Activating Snake Den does not reverse permanent physical alterations. For example, if your heart is removed, it does not reappear when you activate this power.\n\nThe snakes resemble natural snakes typical of the average in size for their species. Each of your snakes has your Mental attribute, Social attribute, focuses and skills. Each of your serpents has a Physical attribute equal to half of your own Physical attribute (round up). While under the effects of Snake Den, your snakes retain the immunity to grapple and the ability to make venomous bite attacks provided by Form of the Serpent. By default, these serpents inflict 1 point of aggravated damage with a successful Brawl attack. If your character possesses any Potence powers, your snakes’ attacks are armor-piercing and inflict 2 points\nof aggravated damage.\n\nEach snake has 5 health levels (1 Healthy, 2 Injured, and 2 Incapacitated). Your merits, flaws, and powers do not affect the health levels of your serpents. If your character possesses any Fortitude powers, each of your snakes automatically negates 1 point of normal or aggravated damage each time they suffer damage. If your serpents attempt to retest in combat, each creature must spend Willpower separately; they use your Willpower pool to do so.\n\nIn addition, your snakes can squirm into narrow spaces and writhe out of reach; as a result, unless you are physically confined in a specially secured location, such as a watertight tank, you may declare the nest’s intent to fair escape. Each snake in the nest must be involved in a suitable challenge in order to successfully prevent your fair escape, according to the normal rules of fair escape.\n\nSnakes created by Snake Den can separate and perform individual tasks, but they must remain within one mile of each other. You can use a standard action to return to your human form at the location of any serpent created by this power. When you revert to human form, you automatically reabsorb any of your snakes that are within your line of sight. Snakes not within your line of sight crumble at the same moment, turning into ash. When Snake Den ends, you take 2 points of aggravated damage for each animal that was destroyed, 1 point of aggravated damage for each animal that was injured or incapacitated, and you lose 2 points of Blood for each animal that was outside of your line of sight when you reformed. Damage taken from reverting to human form cannot be reduced or negated, but it cannot kill your character (although it may result in torpor). If all the snakes in a Snake Den nest are destroyed, the power’s user dies.\n\nSnakes created by this power are considered to be one entity for the purpose of powers that modify an individual’s behavior. If one serpent is targeted by a Dominate power, all the snakes in the nest suffer the effects of that power. If one snake cannot break an individual’s Majesty, none of the serpents in the nest can attack that individual. Note that each snake in the nest must still be targeted by separate challenges in order to prevent fair escape, however.
